# PFRM
The quest to make discord matchmaking has begun.
It started with PFRMv1
hand entered stats
+3, -3 system for wins/losses
Then came PFRMV2
with an ELO calculator with a K of 12

PFRMV2.01 https://gyazo.com/62b1016055a631827e6fc0762f4659cc
PFRMV2.5 added a database to hold ratings along with a new ranking system
in PFRMv3 we introduced member based MM.
in PFRMv3.5 we added autoqueue, voice match support, and registration. 
This brought the entire system to new levels of efficiency. The match organizer needs to run 2 commands to make it work.
